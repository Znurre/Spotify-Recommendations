# Spotify Recommendations
A small program to manage recommendations for spotify playlists.

# Why?
I have a playlist on Spotify which have gained popularity and wanted a way for people to recommend me new music.

Thought it would be too simple to add an email, so I decided to make a small web application for it. Turned out more advanced than I had initially intended.

# Features
* Users can send recommendations via links or on-site search.
* Owner can add tracks to the playlist from the Admin-view.

# Future features
* Send an email when receiving a new recommendation
* Add more than one "owner" of a playlist.
* We'll see.

# How hard is it to implement as-is?
With a bit of knowledge of javascript and css it should be fairly easy to customise for your own needs.
